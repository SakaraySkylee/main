(5) Guest System Suggestion

 Guest need to replace reading with entertainment, so you can implement other stuffs like watching tv, or singing etc.

 Guest Rarity
    Common  - Basic travelers; always appear
	Rare - Slightly unique visuals; higher payout or faster need processing
	Unique - Theme-based with special visuals and temporary buffs when served
	Legendary - Extremely rare guests with high gold payout, double rewards
	Seasonal/Event - Limited-time guests tied to holiday or theme events
	
  Rarity	    Free Player Drop Rate	Premium Player Bonus
    Common	    60%	                    +10%
    Rare	    30%	                    +15%
    Unique	    9%	                    Guaranteed via theme pass
    Legendary	0.25%	                Increased chance via spins
    Seasonal	Limited by event	    Instant access via bundle or pass

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

(6) Guest Buff/Drop system
    
	A Guest/Miniature Guest NPC must have buff on things and stuffs, negative buff might not benifit the game at early stages or not at all
	e.g.
	
    Guest	                Theme	              Buff	                                                    Duration
    Candy Artisan	        Whimsy Factory	      +5% payout from all guests	                            5 mins
    Dragon Monk	            Sky Temple	          Warmth items work +15% faster	                            10 mins
    Phantom Dancer	        Haunted Lodge	      2× souvenir drop rate                                     5 mins
    Imperial Merchant	    Lunar Palace	      Instantly tips 30g upon leaving	                        Instant
    Wandering Poet	        Japanese Ryokan	      Sleep bar restores 10% faster	                            Until guest leaves
    Clocksmith	            Clockwork Manor	      Slows down need decay for all guests	                    5 mins
    Magic Professor	        Wizard Hall	          One random need instantly fulfilled for next 3 guests	    N/A
    Sunfire Dancer	        Sunfire Pavilion	  +10% boost to all buff durations	                        10 mins
    Ghost Chef	            Haunted Lodge	      Food meter fills twice as fast	                        10 mins
    Frost Bard	            Frozen                Keep	All needs restore 5% faster during snow events	    During Snow
	
	
	When guest leaves esp. of the unique, legendary and seaonal guest has a chance to give random souvenir at a very low chance

    Souvenir	            A chance to get Collectibles furnitures and stuff tied to guest’s theme (tradeable or displayable)
    Guest NPC	            A chance to get Chibi-style guest that can walk around your haven (like pets that will give bonuses/buffs ^_~ wink this might make the next grow a haven a thing)(tradeable)
 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
   
(7) Guest traits system
	Guest giving traits to guest will make the game a bit challenging but managable, can be combine with 
	
    Lazy	              Sleeps longer, pays more for beds
    Rushed	              Leaves faster if not served quickly
    Hungry	              Needs food twice before full
    Entertainer	          Increases mood of nearby guests
    Cold-Resistant	      Needs less warmth during cold weather
    Curious	              Explores more rooms, stays longer
    Nervous	              More likely to leave if noise is high
    Wealthy	              Pays more when fully satisfied
    Night Owl	          Prefers serving during night cycle
    Clumsy	              Takes longer to fulfill any need
 
    more can be added..... to many on my mind right now
	
Some minor suggestions below...

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

(8) Traveler system

	Travelers, will come to your tavern/haven to buy produce... they will not stay on your plot, they will buy produce at large quatity thus guest food choices might suffer
	
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

(9) Haven Star Rating System

    Guest will rate your haven based on quality of rooms, satisfaction
	1 star ~ 5 star haven
	the higher the haven rating the better compensation/reward gained/ all linked above suggestions

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

(10) Improve Stair, Room Walls, Windows and doors
    
	Overhaul the stairs static location and enable it to be rotated
	Allow stairs, wall and more to have other theme based design
	if Themes will be implemented new types of wall could be added

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
(11) Weather Induced buffs/debuffs or events
	
	Since weather will be introduce sooner, this are some my suggested weather and its effects
	
	    Clear Weather: Guests move slightly faster. Ideal for early-game or base state.
		Rain: Guests stay indoors longer once inside.
		Thunderstorm: Higher chance for rare guests seeking shelter.
		Snowstorm: Special “Winter” guests appear.
		Strong Wind / Gale: Guests arrive faster - Guests may refuse to stay in open-sided rooms.
		Fog / Mist: Ghost/Phantom-themed guests appear. - Guests find rooms slower.
		Heatwave: Guests’ warmth bar fills too fast, Guest will take a shower frequently
		Lucky Weather: Guests tips more. and chances of rare guest more frequent
		Meteor Shower: Rare guests are guaranteed to appear, rare guests leave a souvenir, legendary/Theme guest might drop Guest NPC


(12) Crops System (more food types)

	With the crop being teased already, i suggest that crops have quality as well
	from common, rare, excelent, exotic
	crop can be automatically attended by Guest NPC (see #5)
	
	
(13) More furniture (with functions) and decors
